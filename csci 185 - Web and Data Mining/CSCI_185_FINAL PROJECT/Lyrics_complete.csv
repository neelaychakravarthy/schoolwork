Head so good, she a honor roll
She ride the dick like a carnival

Go, go, go, go
Head so good, she a honor roll
She ride the dick like a carnival
I done did the impossible
Go
Ha, ha, ha, schyeah[Verse 1: Rich The Kid & Playboi Carti]
Way too rich to drive a Rove'
Made a milli' off the stove
She like to put it in her nose
Pretty bitch with white toes
I done put on all the bros
I done fucked her in the Rolls (Hahahaha)
I done pulled up in the Ghost
I done reach_d all my goals
Yeah, yeah, pull up with Yeezy and Dolla $ign
I'm all about business, I'm mindin' min_
Pull up in the trenches like Columbine
Pull up with the rocket like NumbaNine
I don't want your hoes
Young nigga reach all the goals
Let her suck the dick, said she was a pro
If she scrape her teeth, I'ma tell her to go [Chorus: Rich The Kid with Choir, Ty Dolla $ign & Playboi Carti]
Go, go, go, go
Head so good, she a honor roll

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
She ride it like Six Flags
We turn up to the max
I whop her from the back
I gave that bitch a cramp
They love me out in France
In the hood, I'm good, I'm stamped
Every day, I dress all black
For a show, nine hundred racks
Middle East call, double that
On my neck a bubble bath
On my wrist, new Cadillac
Cut her off, don't want her back
Little bitch, I'm a superstar
These hoes wanna fuck my car
My dog put a nigga in park
Gotta watch out for the narcs, ayy [Verse 3: Kanye West]
This that Game of Thrones, Yeezy, not the clones
Elon, where my rocket ship? It's time to go home
They served us the porn since the day we was born
Anybody pissed off, gotta make 'em drink the urine
Now I'm Ye-Kelly, bitch, now I'm Bill Cosby, bitch
Now, I'm Puff Daddy rich, that's Me Too me rich
Why she say she sucked my dick? Then she say she ain't sucked my dick?
She gon' take it up the ass like a ventriloquist
I mean since Taylor Swift, since I had the Rollie on the wrist
I'm the new Jesus, bitch, I turn water to Cris'
This for what they did to Chris, they can't do shit with this
Got my kids in a fake school, we ain't—

Go, go, go, go
Head so good, she a honor roll

Go, go, go, go
Head so good, she a honor roll
She'll ride the dick like carnival
I done did the impossible

[Verse 4: Playboi Carti]
She ride the dick like a carnival
Bend her over, havin' flashbacks, she gon' eat me up like a carnivore
It's the way I pop my shit, the hoes not ready, I'm goin' barnacles
Movin', I feel like I'm Jason, can't get arrested, I make 'em stumble
She want a private section, roll off them X's when I'm on Melrose
She tatted my name on her titties, yeah, you can bust it, but it's a borrow
Hol' up, sittin' back, countin' up dubs, I was raised in the borough
She wanna taste it, checkin' the swag today, ho, come back tomorrow
If you know what I know, hide your ho
Just off the facts that we havin' them hunchos
Runnin' around in the lobby, I know that they tired of me havin' like ten hoes
She need some cresidentials just to be presidential, hol' up, hol' up
I'm 'bout to buy her some dentures, make that ho eat me for dinner, woah, woah
Pain all in my eyes, I can't see, uh
I'm 'bout to jump out my body, I'm ready to leap, uh
I'm 'bout to nut on her body and tell the ho leave, 'kay
Fifty mil' stuffed in the bag, tell the whole gang eat, uh
It's Ye and Barti, tell me who fuckin' with we?
I'm hot like Tha Carter, I'm feelin' that ho in my sleep
Dollar signs all in my dreams, I don't never see Z's, woah (Woah-woah)
The swag cover my body like it's a disease, woah (Woah-woah)
[Chorus: Choir]
Go, go, go, go
Head so good, she a honor roll
She ride the dick like a carnival
I done did the impossible
Go, go, go, go

Mockingbird,https://genius.com/Eminem-mockingbird-lyrics,Eminem,"Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum‚Äîsee, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat

don't fuck with Dad!

I created this world
To feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina

Earned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket
Bless your ear holes while you react, acting
Gobsmacked, 
don't hesitate

Don't sleep on a boy who can't fall asleep twice

Originated right in front of your eyes
If you can't see, I am Clancy, prodigal son
Done running,

you bow to the masses
Get kicked to the curb for passin' the classes
Half empty, half full, save half for your taxes
Then overtake your former self

Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

Days feel like a perfect length
I don't need them any longer, but for goodness' sake
Do the years seem way too short for my soul, coraz√≥n
Way too short for my soul, coraz√≥n

I don't need them any longer, but for goodness' sake

Lose Yourself,https://genius.com/Eminem-lose-yourself-lyrics,Eminem,"Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home,
 that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada,
 
and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed,
 
plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go

May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?

Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture 
It's the return of the
 
""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement 
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady,
 
I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
 
they've got the 
Discovery Channel
, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on

""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD 
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me

I'm like a head trip to listen to 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it , I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings 
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

When I Was Your Man,https://genius.com/Bruno-mars-when-i-was-your-man-lyrics,Bruno Mars,"Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like 
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize

That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

I'll be the first to say that
I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you love to dance
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man

Stan,https://genius.com/Eminem-stan-lyrics,Eminem,"My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, 
I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, ""no""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
 You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan‚ÄîP.S. We should be together too

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word‚ÄîI don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now‚ÄîI'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together‚Äîthink about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim‚Äîshut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up‚Äîsee? I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot‚Äîhow am I supposed to send this shit out?!

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was‚Äîit was you
Damn...

Anuv Jain - Husn (Romanized),https://genius.com/Genius-romanizations-anuv-jain-husn-romanized-lyrics,Genius Romanizations,"Haan, haan

Dekho, dekho, kaisi baatein yahaan ki
Hain saath par hain saath naa bhi
Kya itni aasaan hain?
Dekho, dekho, jaise mere iraade
Vaise kahan tere yahaan the
Haan, kitni nadaan main

Mere husn ke ilaawa kabhi dil bhi maang lo naa
Haaye, pal mein main pighal jaaun, haan
Abh aisa naa karo ki dil jud naa paaye vaapis
Teri baaton se bikhar jaaun, haan

Maana zamana hai deewana
Isiliye tune naa jaana
Tere liye main kaafi hun
Dekho, dekho, yeh zamaane se thak kar
Aate ho kyun masoom ban kar?
Tere liye main kya hi hun? 

Phir aate kyun yahaan karne aankhon mein ho baarish?
Abh aaye toh theher jaao na
Aur puchcho naa zara mer–µ din ke baare mein bhi
Bas itn–µ mein sambhal jaaun, haan

Honthon se hota na bayaan
Meri yeh aankhon mein, aankhon mein toh dekho
Kaisa naseeb hai mera
Milke bhi naa mujhe mila
Meri yeh aankhon mein, aankhon mein toh dekho
Teri adhoori si wafa
Maangu, main maangu aur naa
Meri yeh aankhon mein, aankhon mein toh dekho

Dekho, dekho, kaisi kheenchi lakeerein
Chahe bhi dil toh bhi naa jeete
Main iss daud mein nahin
Dekho, dekho, kaisi baatein yahaan ki
Baatein yahin dekhun jahan bhi

100 MESSAGGI,https://genius.com/Lazza-100-messaggi-lyrics,Lazza,"Ti prego, non cominciare
Sai che per me √® gi√† difficile credere a quanto mi facevi male
Ma, se me l'avessi chiesto, avrei scalato l'Everest a mani nude
Anche se odio il freddo e soffro pure di vertigini, io me ne frego
Quando menti, io ti credo
So che sono pi√π di mille quelle cose di me che non tolleravi
Parlare con te √® come cercare di afferrare il vento con le mani
Se avevo un problema, mi dicevi di parlarne con chi se ne intende
Guardavo cadere tutto a pezzi come fosse l'11 settembre
Dimmi ancora una bugia, poi una bugia, poi la verit√†
Era tutto una follia, per√≤ una follia per te non si fa
Non ero pi√π a casa mia, neanche a casa mia, solo mille guai
Penso a Davide e Golia, io sar√≤ Golia, tu mi ucciderai
E te l'avrei lasciato fare, perch√© ero fuori di testa
Dimmi, quando ci si perde, a cosa serve fare festa?
Fumo 'sti fiori del male, tutto quello che mi resta
Ora che mi sento inerme come un verme in fondo al mezcal

Scordati che mi conosci, ora √® tardi anche se piangi
√à inutile che mi angosci, mi mandi cento messaggi
A cui non risponder√≤, non ne sono pi√π capace
Sono diventato tutto ci√≤ che odiavo e ti assicuro non mi piace
Dimmelo se te ne accorgi, siamo diventati grandi
Anche se ho dieci orologi, non recuperer√≤ gli anni
Scusa se non torner√≤, non sai quanto mi dispiace
Che abbiamo fatto la guerra, ma non sapevamo come fare pace

Triste quando ci pensavo
Ci mancava tutto quanto, perfino la data di un anniversario
Scrivevano ""√à fidanzato"" solo perch√© finanziavo
Ti darei da bere il sangue perch√© √® tutto ci√≤ che adesso mi √® rimasto
Credimi, sembra impossibile accettare che oramai ti ho detto: ""Ciao""
Sto in un bilocale che da quando ti ho cacciata sembra una penthouse
Grande tipo il doppio, ma senza la luce, come ci fosse un black out
Non sono sentimentale
Delle volte tu aprivi la porta e io nemmeno ti sentivo entrare
Ti volevo a tutti i costi, ma eravamo opposti proprio come un polo
Stare insieme √® l'arte di risolvere i problemi che non ho da solo
Giuro, non so pi√π chi sono, tutto ci√≤ mi d√† fastidio
'Sto mondo a misura d'uomo mi fa sentire in castigo

Scordati che mi conosci, ora √® tardi anche se piangi
√à inutile che mi angosci, mi mandi cento messaggi
A cui non risponder√≤, non ne sono pi√π capace
Sono diventato tutto ci√≤ che odiavo e ti assicuro non mi piace

All eyes is on me
Won't tell no lies, won't hold my tongue
Don't cry for me
(This_Chicago,_nigga)
(I want some_Juice)

[Verse 1: Bump J & Lil Durk]
I don't have no rapper friends,_I hang wit' The Vultures
Big-ass toaster, hit you with it, flip it over
Big ol' nigga, he's a big ol' goofy, Rudy Gobert
Jump off in that lane, you gon' get put on a poster
LaFerrari F8, Lamborghini Roadster
I turn ten bricks into twelve, them birds had a growth spurt
We gon' do some shoppin' later, I'ma need some throat first
I just got some head in a Ghost, then I ghost her
Yeah, yeah, out of here, your boyfriend a gopher
I see him out with her, I pr_tend like I don't know her
I can't do no f_atures with you, nigga, it's a ""No, sir""
Hardest nigga on Earth, I'm not really from Earth
We don't dial 9-1-1, I let off that chrome first
I put in my own work, better do your homework
I can hear that money callin', I pick up the first ring (Go, go)
What you gon' charge that old man for that pussy?
Girl, don't hurt me [Verse 2: Lil Durk & DJ Pharris]
Iced out all my scammer hoes, boost all they insurance up
Iced out all my ghetto hoes who turned into influencers
Smurkio, fuck that bitch and leave, I don't care who she fuck
Best shit out her closet, it's hot as hell, she got on Yeezy UGGS
I got moes with me, Bump out the feds, mean I got foes with me
You got goofies with you, before I do that, I keep some hoes with me
Askin' for my gun when I'm in Cali', nigga, this your city
Why you DM'in' my bitch actin' like we fuck? These hoes below-silly
Street niggas want ramen, I don't like calamari
Took her out that cheap shit, took her to Bvlgari
Never tell her, ""Sorry,"" this car a Ferrari
Offset with this Cuban link, you think she was Cardi, go (This Chicago, nigga, go)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Three gang leaders with me all times
I don't know who I fucked last night, I got Alzheimer's
I don't know who them hoes is, man, they all lyin'
Brody, tell me who them hoes is, man, they all fine
Huntin' hooligans, and we with the foolishness
How I'm anti-Semitic? I just fucked a Jewish bitch
I just fucked Scooter's bitch and we ran her like Olympics
Got pregnant in the threesome, so whose baby is it?
Whose baby is it?
My niggas puttin' belt to ass, pull up with the switches
This ain't Jimmy Butler, but the heat got extensions
This ain't Columbine, but we came in with the trenches [Verse 4: Ty Dolla $ign & Kanye West]
She askin' me to aim for her neck, 'cause her boyfriend bought that necklace
With the trenches, precious, with the trenches
Fuck it, I scratched another nigga woman up off my checklist
With the trenches, I've been livin' reckless
I wish Takeoff wasn't there that night in Houston, Texas (With the trenches)
Wish I could bring G.Ca$$o back, that was my best friend
Chordz, I need you to give me somethin' big, I'm talkin' 'bout dollar signs
Skinny pants flow, tell the ho, ""No, I don't wanna fuck""
She can suck-suck-suck it 'til she suck it dry
California nigga with some European freaks
Bad-ass bitch from the Middle E-E-E-East wanna lick on me
Stick on me, even though I got security
Even though she got a man, she know he ain't as pure as me, seriously
Soon as I get back, tradin' in my Urus for the Puro' keys
Couple grey hairs up in my beard, that's showin' my maturity, yeah
Ayy, shoutout to my symphony
9th Ave, Spaced Out, we did that shit so differently and brilliantly
Dolla $ign, Iggy, and we birth YG
Fades in the backyard, no talkin', take flight instantly
Ayy, Nate 3D, boot up my nigga, James Koo
My nigga, that's D.R.U.G.$
She snortin' that P out the D
She want me to put some of this coke in her butt, ugh
She Russian, I beat up the pussy for Ukraine
Bought her a bag and I filled it with loose change
Just like my exes, she told me that, ""You changed,"" yeah, yeah, yeah
Dolla'd done rather be fuckin' it up
Still screamin', ""Free TC, Melly, and Thug""
Fuck the police, the DA, and the judge
Way out in Saudi, I found me a plug
Don't wanna go out, she'd rather do drugs
Can't be my main if we met in the club, ooh [Outro: 2 Eleven]
Give me somethin', bitch, I'm talkin' 'bout dollar signs
Look it here, ho, I don't wanna fuck
Here's a buck, but a buck, buck, buck

Because if we've just been sort of relying on our cleverness
Or relying‚Äî, you know, just kind of floating along
Saturn comes along and hits you over the head
Hits you over the head, hits you over the head, and says, ""Wake up""

But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Caus–µ there we ar–µ again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it  all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there 
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there 
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there 
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it 
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear

'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
I think I love you, baby, I think I love you too (Oh-ooh)
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh)
Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice [Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday (Yeah-yeah)
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked—bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you
[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though

First thing you say: I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
""Rot In Pieces,"" uh, that's great
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

Bleeding all over this shit
Can I get, uhm, like, my pants and shit?
Can I just, uhm, get, like, a little...
Like a towel?
Mm-hm

[Verse 1]
Lately my thoughts eating me alive
Laid in the bed
Thinkin' maybe the hate'll finally go away if I'm not alive
Wish I didn't listen
Just like I wish they would understand me one time
I had a breakdown and tatted my entire body except one line
Everything's just fine
(Slippin' again) There I go, slippin' again, I'm actin' different again
I see my family's reflection
Every tim_ I look in the cup and I sip it again
(After this ends) T_ll me, after all this ends
Will I be mentioned again? Why do I care?
If in the end, it's just me and God, like I'm Christian again (Yeah)
(Slim, bring the beat in)
Before my dad left this Earth
He made sure I took on every quality I didn't want
I was supposed to die at birth
Gave me a chance and I fucked it up, give me another one (Mm)
I've been runnin' from
Secrets I hid as a kid and I never confronted 'em
I just called ma, said I forgive her
For not bein' there when I needed one [Chorus]
I'm comin' back, just let me go
I'm comin' back, just let me go, yeah
I'm comin' back, just let me go
I'm comin' back, don't let me go

[Verse 2]
Who am I when the music stops?
And the character that I been playin'
Is really just broken and fuckin' lost?
I swear, I've been tellin' you
Over and over again in all of these songs
But they don't hear nothin' I'm writin'
'Cause they're too busy tryna write me off
And they go on and on and on
It's funny, 'cause if we just sat and talked
You'd see that it's just hard for me to be vulnerable
'Cause I blocked it off
I got trust issues, growin' up
No one was there to hear what I thought
My heart was broken like my ribs as a kid
When me and my father fought (Yeah)
I'm medicating with something that I cannot pronounce
But it's what the doctor gave me
Rehab patient, with a pen and some paper (Mm)
This psychiatrist keeps evaluating
How can I live with the fact
That my hand wasn't on her stomach when we lost the baby?
I don't got no one to turn to
'Cause everyone's dead in my life that was tryna raise me
Searchin' for someone to tell me who I really am
I don't know when I look in the mirror
Constantly dreadin' the day
That the audience might not be screaming for me anymore
The feeling of dying alone
And not leaving anything behind is my biggest fear
Kiss the person that I love
As if I'm never coming back after I leave out the door [Chorus]
I'm comin' back, just let me go (Feelin' like)
I'm comin' back, just let me go, yeah
I'm comin' back, just let me go
I'm comin' back, don't let me go (Mm)
I'm comin' back, just let me go (Mm)
I'm comin' back, just let me go, yeah (Mm)
I'm comin' back, just let me go (Mm)
I'm comin' back, don't let me go"

Per te mi faccio la galera, ma sei tu la mia pena
Mo non ci parliamo pi√π da quando hai morso la mela
Io ti ho dato le spalle, mi hai pugnalato alla schiena

Nei punti in cui mi toccavi ora ho un eritema
Per te cammino sul fuoco, attraverso la bufera
Mi ameresti senza un euro, senza la mia carriera
O mi guarderesti appena e forse ti farei p–µna?
Farei un taglio sul polso lungo quanto il mondo
Per mostrarti la pi√π piccola parte di quanto soffro
S–µi fuggita col vento, ora nel cuore ho un soffio
Mi hai fatto fare nottata come un bruttissimo sogno
Sei un faro a forma di scoglio, di te non ho bisogno
Sei solamente un imbroglio, sei tutto il male del mondo

There's no substitute for pure angelic power!

Well handily, I've got good news
He's a loser, a fossil
And I don't mean to sound hostile,

vacay

Where's he been? Who gives a shit?

Salutations!
Good to be back on the air
Yes, I know it's been a while
Since someone with style treated Hell to a broadcast
Sinners, rejoice!

What a dated voice!

Instead of a clout-chasing mediocre video podcast

How to be brave? How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still, beauty in all she is
I will be brave, I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath, every hour has come to this

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me

I know what you want, I'm readin' the signs
Don't let your moment pass you by
Don't let your moment pass you by
Had to go in my whole life
A hundred percent covered in ice
Put down your phone, cut off the lights, lights
Cut off the lights, covered in ice
And if I go tonight, know that I lived a lovely life
Just make sure my kids are right and it is alright
And if I go tonight, just know I lived a lovely life
Tell my kids to live they life how they wanna live they life

Forgiveness, beg forgiveness
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness
Beg forgiveness

Say you wanna make amends before I go
Now you wanna put your heart on the line
God knows the way you are
I will wait
I will wait, I will wait, I will wait
I will wait
I will wait, I will wait
I will wait, I will wait
I will wait, don't wait, I will wait
I will wait
I will wait
I will wait
Now you wanna be so sad
Wanna be with me so bad after driving me so mad
Yeah, you know, I'm still suffocating on your every lie
Yeah, you know, I'm still wakin' up with murder on my mind
Yeah, you know, I'm still suffocating on your every lie
Yeah, you know, I'm still wakin' up with murder on my mind
And you know

Lilith,https://genius.com/Kid-yugi-lilith-lyrics,Kid Yugi,"Uoh, sei la mia Lilith
Smetto di cercarti, noi non saremo amici
Perch√© pi√π dici ""Ti amo"" e pi√π continuer√≤ a tradirti
Poi quando mi scopri, accorci tutti i tuoi vestiti
Vai con altri maschi, sei convinta di ferirmi
Tu sei Lilith, non vuoi manco pi√π sentirmi
Amore nel bicchiere fa sentire le vertigini
Mi cancelli da IG, ti disegni le lentiggini
Bruttissimi litigi, ne dimentico le origini

Tu mi odi, io lo sento che mi odi
Ti ingoi i miei umori dei fuochi con cui ti ustioni
Penso solo a me stesso, non so darti attenzioni
Mi parli dei tuoi problemi, non so darti soluzioni
Ti affidi alle pozioni, vieni sempre nelle stesse posizioni
Ti affezioni nonostante conosci le mie intenzioni
Una sola anima in pena, cambiano le confezioni
Due bambini con i traumi, cambiano le situazioni
Tutte 'ste relazioni mi sanno di asfissia
La nostra storia che diventa un'elegia
C'√® chi insegue e chi respinge, non √® solo una teoria
Dopo l'orgasmo tutta la magia va via

Qua cambier√† la musica, l'impianto, il DJ
Non capisci cosa ho dentro manco con gli X-ray
Invece tu un mainframe per me che sono Bill Gates
Sognavi un rapper e i main stage, ma casa sembra Carnage
Mi blocchi dappertutto, ci sentiamo per e-mail
Vorrei essere famoso per intasarti l'homepage
Da risentimento ad esaurimento va il tuo range
Cambierei soldi in amore se solo esistesse il change

L'affetto di Misery, le fiamme degli inferi
Il canto delle sirene nei tuoi occhi limpidi

American Pie,https://genius.com/Don-mclean-american-pie-lyrics,Don McLean,"A long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music
Used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die,""

Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die...""

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

And they were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

They were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""

Crying in high school over a high school bitch
And she still in the dark takin' night school, bitch
Look at how we made it like we Mike WiLL, bitch
Wish somebody woulda warned us
When I was fifteen, my soulmate wasn't born yet
African king in a different time
We got multiple wives too, just at different times
Picture this, if every room got a different bitch
Do that make me a po-nigga-mist?
Without the deals, I guarantee I'm still nigga rich
Shit is fuckin' ridiculous

16 CARRIAGES,https://genius.com/Beyonce-16-carriages-lyrics,Beyonce,"Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my dreams away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my dreams away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight

At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray
Had to leave my home at an early age
I saw Mama prayin', I saw Daddy grind
All my tender problems, had to leave behind

It's been umpteen summers, and I'm not in my bed
On the back of the bus in a bunk with the band
Goin' so hard, gotta choose myself
Und–µrpaid and overwhelmed
I might cook, cl–µan, but still won't fold
Still workin' all my life, you know
Only God knows, only God knows

Baby, tell me where you gone, gone, gone?

We can praise Jah in the moonlight
Baby, if you with me, better do right
And I've been gone too long
And I'm hoping that you sing my songs 
I've been on this road for way too long
I've been hoping that we all get along

These roads of flames are catching on fire
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah

Give Jah the thanks and praises
I've been on my own, own, own
But we ain't never left alone, 'lone, 'lone
And if I'm tellin' you the feeling is wrong
Relax a little, friend, this won't take too long
And when you're feeling alone
You can call my phone
Is there a better way to go?
Teach them something before they lose their soul
Oh, no-no, no, freedom is the road
Oh, no-no, no, coming in from the cold
Tell them not to sell it, it's worth more than gold
And guiltiness will catch them in the end

The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls

Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're—""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place""
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!) [Pre-Chorus: Akon]

On the beat, I'm goin'

Leave a bum nigga lookin' embarrassed 
Spent a hundred-fifty on some carats 
That shit cray like them niggas in Paris

Till I Collapse,https://genius.com/Eminem-till-i-collapse-lyrics,Eminem,"(
Yo, left, yo, left
) 'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
(
Yo, left, right, left
) Feel weak, and when you feel weak
(
Yo, left, yo, left
) You feel like you wanna just give up
(
Yo, left, right, left
) But you gotta search within you
(
Yo, left, yo, left
) Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
(
Yo, left, right, left
) And get that motivation to not give up
(
Yo, left, yo, left
) And not be a quitter
(
Yo, left, right, left
) No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof,

'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off,

'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
 ('Til my legs,

I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse 

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes:
 
Reggie,
 
Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andr√© from OutKast,
 
Jada,
 
Kurupt,
 
Nas,
 
and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney ‚Äî 
Nate, hit me!

'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse 

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic,
 
I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
[Chorus: Nate Dogg & 
Eminem

The shadow in the background of the morgue

Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

I miss you, I miss you

Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

Io sono in Italia, maar toch doet het pijn
Ben aan het vluchten van mezelf, roep de hele dag om help
Ja, ik geef zelfs mensen geld, maar d'r is niemand die me helpt
Ik hoef geen escargots, hoef geen fish 'n' chips
Hoef geen paella,
 no, 
ik weet niet eens echt wat dat is
Zet de radio aan, ik hoor Stromae met ""Papaoutai""
Zal niet stoppen, tot ze zeggen, ""Ja, ja, dat doet 'ie goed, ey""

There was nobody that compared to my baby, and nobody came between us nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy, oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks 
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing 'cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'

Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh

Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

In the last ten-thousand years

So long as I've got all of you with me

To build a hotel, I think we need some brick and lumber

Good thing we're in Hell
Check out this little magic number

Start with foundation

A remedial creation for me

It's as easy as can be!

No time for cryin', we've got a lot of work to do
 and
We gotta try and make the best of what's in ruins

New coat of paint!

New lights across the marquee

With a little sorcery

After the battle, 
masterless cattle

Overlords hanging by a thread
With a bit of bravado, maybe tomorrow
We'll be atop the heap

While the rest of Hell's pissing

Alastor's missing

Fled with his tail between his legs
Nature abhors a power vacuum
It leaves room for you and me
The future of Hell belongs to the Vee's

This place reeks of death, there's a chill in the air
And I barely escaped being killed by a hair
""Great Alastor, altruist, died for his friends""
Sorry to disappoint, that is not where this ends
I'm hungry for freedom like never before
The constraints of my deal surely have a backdoor
Once I figure out how to unclip my wings
Guess who will be pulling all the strings?

We can do this 
We'll be better 
Though redemption may take a while
 
Wayward sinners clear their ledger

And we're doing it with a smile!

We're gonna do this, you and me

And then tomorrow, it will be a fuckin' happy day in Hell!"
