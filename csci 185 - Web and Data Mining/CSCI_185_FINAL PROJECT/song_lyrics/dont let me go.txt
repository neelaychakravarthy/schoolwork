[Intro: mgk & Elisa Jane]
Bleeding all over this shit
Can I get, uhm, like, my pants and shit?
Can I just, uhm, get, like, a little...
Like a towel?
Mm-hm

[Verse 1]
Lately my thoughts eating me alive
Laid in the bed
Thinkin' maybe the hate'll finally go away if I'm not alive
Wish I didn't listen
Just like I wish they would understand me one time
I had a breakdown and tatted my entire body except one line
Everything's just fine
(Slippin' again) There I go, slippin' again, I'm actin' different again
I see my family's reflection
Every tim_ I look in the cup and I sip it again
(After this ends) T_ll me, after all this ends
Will I be mentioned again? Why do I care?
If in the end, it's just me and God, like I'm Christian again (Yeah)
(Slim, bring the beat in)
Before my dad left this Earth
He made sure I took on every quality I didn't want
I was supposed to die at birth
Gave me a chance and I fucked it up, give me another one (Mm)
I've been runnin' from
Secrets I hid as a kid and I never confronted 'em
I just called ma, said I forgive her
For not bein' there when I needed one [Chorus]
I'm comin' back, just let me go
I'm comin' back, just let me go, yeah
I'm comin' back, just let me go
I'm comin' back, don't let me go

[Verse 2]
Who am I when the music stops?
And the character that I been playin'
Is really just broken and fuckin' lost?
I swear, I've been tellin' you
Over and over again in all of these songs
But they don't hear nothin' I'm writin'
'Cause they're too busy tryna write me off
And they go on and on and on
It's funny, 'cause if we just sat and talked
You'd see that it's just hard for me to be vulnerable
'Cause I blocked it off
I got trust issues, growin' up
No one was there to hear what I thought
My heart was broken like my ribs as a kid
When me and my father fought (Yeah)
I'm medicating with something that I cannot pronounce
But it's what the doctor gave me
Rehab patient, with a pen and some paper (Mm)
This psychiatrist keeps evaluating
How can I live with the fact
That my hand wasn't on her stomach when we lost the baby?
I don't got no one to turn to
'Cause everyone's dead in my life that was tryna raise me
Searchin' for someone to tell me who I really am
I don't know when I look in the mirror
Constantly dreadin' the day
That the audience might not be screaming for me anymore
The feeling of dying alone
And not leaving anything behind is my biggest fear
Kiss the person that I love
As if I'm never coming back after I leave out the door [Chorus]
I'm comin' back, just let me go (Feelin' like)
I'm comin' back, just let me go, yeah
I'm comin' back, just let me go
I'm comin' back, don't let me go (Mm)
I'm comin' back, just let me go (Mm)
I'm comin' back, just let me go, yeah (Mm)
I'm comin' back, just let me go (Mm)
I'm comin' back, don't let me go
