How much to stop the clock from speedin'? They might try to slow down
How much to stop my daughter from growin'? I just can't take it now
'Cause she just doing all the shit I did when I was her age
I don't know how I'm gonna tell her, but her dad's just afraid
Of her choices, know that I've been through it
I just hope I haven't been the wrong influence
Put her on game before the world put her through it
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh
That's why I gotta break the curses that were sent for me
This is hard work working, this ain't destiny
My motivation is just lookin' at my family tree
I'm tryna make sure I contribute for the legacy

Once again, the clouds are gatherin' to release what they held in (
Again-again
, once again)
Once again, the clouds are gatherin' to release what they held in

Once again, the clouds are gathering to release what they held in (
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
