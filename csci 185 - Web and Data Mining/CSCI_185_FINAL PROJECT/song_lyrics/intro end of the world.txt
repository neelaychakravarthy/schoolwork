Uh

How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship?
Aren't you really s'posed to know that shit?
Feel it in your bones and own that shit? I don't know
Then I had this interaction I've been thinkin' 'bout for like five weeks
Wonder if he's thinkin' 'bout it too and smiling
Wonder if he knows that that's been what's inspirin' me
Wonder if he's judgin' me like I am right now

I don't care
I'd rather tell the truth 
Than make it worse for you, mm 

If the sun refused to shine
Baby, would I still be your lover?
Would you want me there?
If the moon went dark tonight
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would I be the one on your mind, your mind, your mind?
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would you be the one on mine?
