They say the sun shines for all
But in some people world, it never shine at all

These roads of flames are catching on fire
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Showed you I loved you, you called me a liar
Oh, no-no, no, no, no

Baby, tell me where you gone, gone, gone?
I've been fiendin' for your love so long
We can praise Jah in the moonlight
Baby, if you with me, better do right
And I've been gone too long
And I'm hoping that you sing my songs 
I've been on this road for way too long
I've been hoping that we all get along

These roads of flames are catching on fire
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Showed you I loved you, you called me a liar

Give Jah the thanks and praises
I've been on my own, own, own
But we ain't never left alone, 'lone, 'lone
And if I'm tellin' you the feeling is wrong
Relax a little, friend, this won't take too long
And when you're feeling alone
You can call my phone
Is there a better way to go?
Teach them something before they lose their soul
Oh, no-no, no, freedom is the road
Oh, no-no, no, coming in from the cold
Tell them not to sell it, it's worth more than gold
And guiltiness will catch them in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah
They'll try to manipulate you through your pockets
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Now you're gonna bring the funk with the optic, with the vision
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Trying to control your soul and take control 
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
No we don't play that game right here to win power
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
