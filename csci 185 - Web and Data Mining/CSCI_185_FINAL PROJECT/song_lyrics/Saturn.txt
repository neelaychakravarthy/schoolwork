If there's another universe
Please make some noise 
Give me a sign 
This can't be life
If there's a point to losing love
Repeating pain 
It's all the same 
I hate this place

Stuck in this paradigm
Don't believe in paradise
This must be what Hell is like
There's got to be more, got to be more
Sick of this head of mine
Intrusive thoughts, they paralyzÐµ
Nirvana's not as advertised
TherÐµ's got to be more, been here before

Ooh 
Life's better on Saturn
Got to break this pattern
Of floating away
Ooh 
Find something worth saving
It's all for the taking
I always say
See SZA Live
Get tickets as low as $157

I'll be better on Saturn
None of this matters
Dreaming of Saturn, oh

If karma's really real
How am I still here?
Just seems so unfair
I could be wrong though
If there's a point to being good
Then where's my reward?
The good die young and poor
I gave it all I could

Stuck in this terradome 
All I see is terrible 
Making us hysterical 
There's got to be more, got to be more
Sick of this head of mine 
Intrusive thoughts, they paralyze 
Nirvana's not as advertised 
There's got to be more, been here before

Ooh 
Life's better on Saturn
Got to break this pattern
Of floating away
Ooh 
Find something worth saving
It's all for the taking
I always say

I'll be better on Saturn
None of this matters
Dreaming of Saturn, oh
