How can it be? You and me
Might be meant to be, can't unsee it
But I don't wanna cause no scene
I'm usually so unproblematic
So independent, tell me why
'Cause the boy is mine, mine

Somethin' about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over 
And God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
ThÐµ boy is mine
Watch me take my timÐµ
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is mine

Please know this ain't what I planned for
Probably wouldn't bet a dime or my life on
There's gotta be a reason why
My girls, they always come through in a sticky situation
Say, "It's fine" 
Happens all the time
You might also like

Somethin' about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over 
And God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy isâ

And I know it's simply meant to be
And I, I take full accountability for all these tears
Promise you I'm not usually
Like this, shit, it's like news to me, to me
But I can't ignore my heart, boy

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him 
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is mine
