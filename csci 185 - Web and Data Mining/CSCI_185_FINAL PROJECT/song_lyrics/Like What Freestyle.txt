Ayo, let me put some gas in this motherfuckin' year, bitch
I ain't really talked my shit in a minute
Like who the fuck these bitches really think they talkin' to?
Like, bitch, is you fuckin' dumb?

Classy and a cunt 
Blocks and money gettin' spunt 
Like , like what? 
Like a Coach bag, baby, this ain't what you want 
If I ask for it, all I wanna hear is, "Yes" 
Bitch said she wanna be my opp, God bless 
Look, I ain't even got dressed
Any L that I took, come after YS
Oh, man 

Baby, here we go again 
Pussy real fat, probably got a double chin
First, that bitch hate me, then this bitch hate me
And somehow, they link up and they become friends, like, how?
Bitch, pipe down 
Moodboard, all y'all imitatin' my style 
Bad bitch, red lips, let me show you
White toes, eatin' yellowtail out of Nobu
Uh, keep a hater obsessed
In my comments, havin' a dick suckin' contest 
I'm pressure, y'all pressed 
Y'all don't get addressed, y'all's gettin' outdressed, look 
It's a look when I'm hoppin' out the V 
Red wig hangin' down to my knees 
It's your birthday, but they talking 'bout me 
Why you mad? Take a picture, say, "Cheese" 
You dumb, you slow, you wildin' 
Got your first pair of Ricks, now you stylin'? 
Everything you got, I had five years before
I put it on the 'Gram  'fore it even hit the store, look

Oh, man 

I know y'all bitches be horsin' 
Lookin' this good is really exhaustin' 
Diamonds hit, Stone Cold Steve Austin 
Just got my lasered pussy smooth like a dolphin 
Top notch bitch get the most, not the lesser 
Bitches look big like third trimester 
Every time I pose, these bitches get stress-er
Y'all be puttin' on shit, I don't never
Bitches be hatin' on the low, I peep it
If I say anything mean, I mean it
I ain't never lost no nigga I needed
I'm rich, I ain't gettin' in no pool that's not heated 
Big ass yacht and I'm havin' sex on it
Her life so trash, think I put a hex on it
Bitches be laughin', like, ho, what's funny?
You braggin' on a nigga that be dyin' to fuck me
