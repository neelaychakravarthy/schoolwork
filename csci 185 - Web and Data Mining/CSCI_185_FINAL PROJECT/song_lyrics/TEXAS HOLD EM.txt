This ain't Texas 
Ain't no hold 'em 
So lay your cards down, down, down, down
So park your Lexus 
And throw your keys up
 
Stick around, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round 
And I'll be damned if I can't slow-dance with you
Come pour some sugar on me, honey too
It's a real-life boogie and a real-life hoedown
Don't be a bitch, come take it to the floor now, woo, ha 

There's a tornado 
In my city 
Hit the basement 
That shit ain't pretty 
Rugged whiskey 
'Cause we survivin' 
Off 
red-cup kisses
, sweet redemption, passin' time, yeah

Ooh, one step to the right
We headed to the dive bar we always thought was nice
Ooh, run me to the left
Then spin me in the middle, boy, I can't read your mind

Comin' at us 
Too hot to think straight 
Too cold to panic 
All of the problems
Just feel dramatic 
And now we're runnin' to the first bar that we find, yeah
