What the fuck I'ma say in the intro?
Hahaha
You want me to say somethin' so bad
(
Stop playin' with 'em, Riot
)
Can you, please?

Think you the shit, bitch?
You not even the fart 
I be goin' hard 
I'm breakin' they hearts, like
Bitches be quick, but I'm quicker 
Bitches be thick, but I'm thicke
r 
She could be rich, but I'm richer 

Take-takin' her man 
Don't give a fuck 
Out in the Yams 
And I'm keepin' one tucked 
I make me some jams 
Unlock that advance 
I said four hundred bands 
Just to do my lil' dance 
Bitch, I'm a brand 
Bitch, I'm a baddie, I get what I want 
All in Balenci', I look like a bum
I got the jatty, he just wanna hump 
Walk through and start shakin' my hips
I'ma dip when I stack all my chips 
Strip a dummy, I want the whole 'fit
I got a French nigga sendin' me tips, grrah

Think you the shit, bitch?
You not even the fart 
I be goin' hard 
I'm breakin' they hearts, like
Bitches be quick, but I'm quicker 
Bitches be thick, but I'm thicker 
She could be rich, but I'm richer 

His bitch at home playin' dress-up 
She must've thought she could catch up 
I got my foot on they necks, I can't let up 
She all on the floor, told her get up 
She my son, but I ain't her mammy 
Bitches can't stand me 
Eat through my panties 
Hard knock life, no Annie
I need a vacay, I'm losin' my tan 
I'd lose anything before my man
I'm a pretty bitch, I don't like fightin'
On the beat, I'm goin' 
Super Saiyan
 
I said, "Mirror, mirror, who the fairest?" 
Leave a bum nigga lookin' embarrassed 
Spent a hundred-fifty on some carats 
That shit cray like them niggas in Paris

Think you the shit, bitch?
You not even the fart 
I be goin' hard 
I'm breakin' they hearts 
Bitches be quick, but I'm quicker 
Bitches be thick, but I'm thicker 
She could be rich, but I'm richer
