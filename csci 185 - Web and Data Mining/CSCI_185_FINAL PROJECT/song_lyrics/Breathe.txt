I was bored, bought a jet, made a billion 
Nah, fuck that, bitch, I need a trillion 
Nah, fuck that, bitch, I need to feel it 
Made me so damn mad, made me feel it 
I won't ever give you time to 
I 
won't ever give a fuck if you
 
I don't really give a fuck about you 
You need to chill, you need to breathe 
I'ma ask you to leave 
Yeah, my money so deep
 
And as far as I could tell, they wanna sound like me , they wanna be like me

I'ma cut it open, I'm doin' surgery
In the limelight, make 'em go insane
Yeah, make 'em go insane
Why the fuck would you come?
Yeah, when you level up, you makin' money, billion
And you make your money taller than the ceiling
 
I told you, I lost all feeling 
Hold your breath 'til you pass out 
I hope you die, you crash out 
I recommend you cash out 
Heard you went up, now you goin' down
 
Now you know I don't stress
I could not care less
But she know I'm the best
Got 'em turnin' they heads

I know I'm a asshole 
I know when I dip and go 
I know when I lose control 
Got the system on overload  
I don't fuck with you, squish you like a bug 
They ain't fuck with me so it's fake love 
I won't shake your hand, bitch, you need a glove 
Wash the blood off my hands, I need Dove 
I said fuck love, bitch, you need to tug
 
I made a fuck ton of money, you make nun' 
I hit home runs, bitch, you boutta bunt 
I won't breathe, 'cause it's fun
