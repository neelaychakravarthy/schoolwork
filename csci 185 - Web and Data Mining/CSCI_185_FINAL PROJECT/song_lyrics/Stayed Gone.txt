That fucker is back!
[
VALENTINO
, spoken]
Yeah, I thought he was gone for good too

It's been seven years!

You still pissed he almost beat you that time?

Uh, fuck you

Just saying

Things have changed a lot since he left town

That's for sure

I gotta send a message of who's really in charge of things now

Welcome home
I'm gonna make you wish that you'd stayed gone
Say hello to a new status quo
Everyone knows that there's a brand new dawn
Turn the TV on!

Welcome to the show

Top of the hour
, and we're discussing a certain 
has-been
Who has been spotted cavorting around town

Welcome to the show

After a seven-year absence
Did anybody miss him?

Welcome to the show
[VOX,

Did anybody notice?
More on tonight's program
So, the 
Radio Demon
 is back in town
Why is he hanging around?
What does that mean for your family?
Well handily, I've got good news
He's a loser, a fossil
And I don't mean to sound hostile, 
but the demon is a coward!
You can take that as gospel
Pulling my viewers? Impossible
I'm visual, he's barely audible
Stop giving him the time of day, don't listen to a word he'd say
I hope he had a nice 
vacay
, 
but he should've stayed away

While he hid in radio, we've pivoted to video
Now his medium is getting bloody rare
Hell's been better since he split
Where's he been? Who gives a shit?

Salutations!
Good to be back on the air
Yes, I know it's been a while
Since someone with style treated Hell to a broadcast
Sinners, rejoice!

What a dated voice!

Instead of a clout-chasing mediocre video podcast

Come on!

Is Vox insecure, pursuing allure?
Flitting between this fad and that, is nothing working?

Ignore his chirping!

Every day, he's got a new format!
[VOX, 
VOX & STAFF
]
You're looking at the future, 
he's the shit that comes before that!

Is Vox as strong as he purports?
Or is it based on his support?
He'd be powerless without the other Vees

Oh, please!

And here's the sugar on the cream
He asked me to join 
his team
!

H-hold on!

I said no, and now he's pissy
That's the tea!

You old-timey prick, I'll show you suf-ffering

Uh oh, the TV is buffering!

I'll destroy you, yo-ou lit-tleâ

I'm afraid you've lost your signal

Let's begin
I'm gonna make you wish that I'd stayed gone
, 
tune on in
When I'm done
, 
your status quo will know its race is run
Oh, this will be fun

Fuck!
