It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two, twenty-two

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Uh-uh, uh-uh 
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleeping

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

 I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if 
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if 
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two , twenty-two 
Twenty-two, twenty-two 

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you 
Woah, ooh, yeah, eh-yeah

 I don't know about you 
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if 
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me 
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're 
Twenty-two , twenty-two 
Twenty-two , twenty-two 

It feels like one of those nights 
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights 
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights 
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
