Hmm

We could go pop all the champagne in California
We could have omakase in Tokyo if you wanna
Hypothetically, we  could do 
Anything that we'd like
We could hit up all the slopes in matching snowsuits
We could hang out at the Louvre all night if you want to
We could spend every dime
But I don't want  anything 
But more time

No matter what we do
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
No ordinary things with you
It's funny, but it's true
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
As long as I'm with you

You hit just like the first sip of wine after a long day
You hit like my biggÐµst fan when I hear what the critiquÐµs say
You hit just like a green light when I'm stuck runnin' real late
I don't need no diamonds, just your time
You might also like

No matter what we do
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
No ordinary things with you
It's funny, but it's true
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
As long as I'm with you

Ordinary thing, ordinary things with you
Ordinary thing, as long as I'm with you

And when he'd come home and I'd see him, when he first gets off that train
It was like God almighty arrived
It was like seein' daylight
I mean, I could've packed up and left a million times
You know? It's not that we never fought
You can overcome that
You know? It-it's very easy
And as I told her, never go to bed without kissin' goodnight
That's the worst thing to do, don't ever, ever do that
And if you can't, and if you don't feel comfortable doing it
You're in the wrong place, get out
