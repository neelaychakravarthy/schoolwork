Qu'est-ce que je vais te nommer?
Je vais te nommer, "L'amour"
"L'amour tendre"

Wait 'til I turn my love on
Wait 'til, wait 'til
Wait 'til I turn my love on
I'm no cheap thrill
I'm a rollercoaster ride, baby, jump on
Come on, come on
'Cause, baby, if you can't tell 
You're what I wanna love on, oh

This doesn't have to be some sort of mathematical equation
Slip off your jeans, slide in the sheets
Screaming "Yes!" in quotations
Clock in, baby, get to work
Night shift, but with all the perks
Timestampin' when you fell in lovÐµ
Time can't mess with us


If you think about fallin'
Got you coverÐµd like garments

I deserve an applause for
Keeping you up late 'til you can't see straight, just wait, woo
You might also like

Wait 'til I turn my love on
Wait 'til, wait 'til
Wait 'til I turn my love on 
I'm no cheap thrill
I'm a rollercoaster ride, baby, jump on
Come on, come on
'Cause, baby, if you can't tell 
You're what I wanna love on, oh
Wait 'til I turn my love on 
Wait 'til, wait 'til
Wait 'til I turn my love on 
You'll get your thrill
Just promise you'll be patient with the outcome
Oh, come on
'Cause, baby, if you can't tell 
You're what I wanna love on, oh

Why we conversin' over this steak tartare when we could be
Somewhere other than here
Makin' out in the back of a car
Or in the back of a bar?
Or we could make a memoir, yeah
On the back wall of the last stall
In the bathroom at The Bazaar


If you think about fallin'
Got you covered like garments 

I deserve an applause for
Keeping you up late 'til you can't see straight, just wait, woo

Wait 'til I turn my love on
Wait 'til, wait 'til
Wait 'til I turn my love on 
I'm no cheap thrill
I'm a rollercoaster ride, baby, jump on
Come on, come on
'Cause, baby, if you can't tell 
You're what I wanna love on, oh
Wait 'til I turn my love on 
Wait 'til, wait 'til
Wait 'til I turn my love on 
You'll get your thrill
Just promise you'll be patient with the outcome
Oh, come on
'Cause, baby, if you can't tell 
You're what I wanna love on, oh

Wait 'til I, oh, yeah
Wait 'til I
Baby, if you can't tell
You're what I wanna love on, oh
