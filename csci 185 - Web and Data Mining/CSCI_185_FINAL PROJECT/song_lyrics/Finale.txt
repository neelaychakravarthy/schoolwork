He did it for us, the ultimate sacrifice
He gave me his trust
, and look how we paid the price
This bloodshed could have been avoided
If I convinced Heaven to work together
I tookâaâhotelâand I destroyedâit
I know Iâcould have done better
Better, instead of letting you down

Come on little lady, why the frown?
In the last ten-thousand years
You're the first one to change this town
You can do this, now I know it!
For your story is just begun
You can't quit now, 
hell, you owe it
There's still damage to be undone
You've changed my mind
, 
you've touched their hearts
Found the good in souls gone bad
The stage is wrecked, the crowd is gone
But by God, Charlie!
The show, it must go on

We can do this, we can build it
Best hotel that you've ever seen
Twice the bedrooms, we can fill it
You might also like

With more sinners than you can dream

It starts with you

You know it's true

Fulfill your destiny
!

So long as I've got all of you with me

To build a hotel, I think we need some brick and lumber

Good thing we're in Hell
Check out this little magic number

Start with foundation

A remedial creation for me

It's as easy as can be!

No time for cryin', we've got a lot of work to do
 and
We gotta try and make the best of what's in ruins

New coat of paint!

New lights across the marquee

With a little sorcery

After the battle, 
masterless cattle

Overlords hanging by a thread
With a bit of bravado, maybe tomorrow
We'll be atop the heap

While the rest of Hell's pissing

Alastor's missing

Fled with his tail between his legs
Nature abhors a power vacuum
It leaves room for you and me
The future of Hell belongs to the Vee's

This place reeks of death, there's a chill in the air
And I barely escaped being killed by a hair
"Great Alastor, altruist, died for his friends"
Sorry to disappoint, that is not where this ends
I'm hungry for freedom like never before
The constraints of my deal surely have a backdoor
Once I figure out how to unclip my wings
Guess who will be pulling all the strings?

We can do this 
We'll be better 
Though redemption may take a while
 
Wayward sinners clear their ledger

And we're doing it with a smile!

Yeah!

Oh, this guy...

We'll make a difference, wait and see

We're gonna do this, you and me

And then tomorrow, it will be a fuckin' happy day in Hell!
