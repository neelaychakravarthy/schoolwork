We wanted to fuck with real love
Wanted it sweet, so pure and warm
Never only sleepin' over
We wanted to fuck like all the time
And when you got back from your flight
It was the first thing we did

And when you say you want it all
I know you want it all
Baby, take it all from me
And when you drag me on the floor
And the blue Tejano's on
You keep your eyes on me

So get in the waves, swim in your leather
I always will make it feel like you were the last one
So get in the waves like it was the first time
Bless your heart, make you part of my life forever

In shorts so high-waist
The girl in the arcade
Said they were the shortest ever
And the rest like "Holiday"
The live one where she sang
Dancin' in a polka-dot top
See Cigarettes After Sex Live
Get tickets as low as $43
You might also like

And when you say you want it all
I know you want it all
Baby, take it all from me
And when you drag me on the floor
And the blue Tejano's on
You keep your eyes on me

So get in the waves, swim in your leather
I always will make it feel like you were the last one
So get in the waves like it was the first time
Bless your heart, make you part of my life forever
Get in the waves, swim in your leather
I always will make it feel like you were the last one
So get in the waves like it was the first time
Bless your heart, make you part of my life forever and always
And always
