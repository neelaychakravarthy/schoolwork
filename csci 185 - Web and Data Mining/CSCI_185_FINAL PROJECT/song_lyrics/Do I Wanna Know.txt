Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

 If this feelin' flows both ways?
 Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
 That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you
You might also like

So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

 If this feelin' flows both ways?
 Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
 That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you 
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few? 
'Cause I always do 
Maybe I'm too 
Busy bein' yours 
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

 If this feelin' flows both ways?
 Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
 That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

 
Too busy bein' yours to fall

 
Ever thought of callin', darlin'?

 
Do you want me crawlin' back to you?
